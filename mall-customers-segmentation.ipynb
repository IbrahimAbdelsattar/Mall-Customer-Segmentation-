**Chart Overview:**\nThe following chart displays the **distribution of customer ages** in the dataset. It uses a **histogram** with an overlaid **kernel density estimate (KDE)** to give us a smooth representation of the age distribution. The histogram is divided into **30 bins**, which helps visualize the spread and concentration of customer ages across the dataset.\n\n### **Key Insights:**\n1. **Peak in Younger Demographics:**\n   - The **highest frequency** of customers is observed in the **early 30s**, with ages such as **32, 35, 19, and 31** having the largest counts.\n   - This indicates that the mall has a **strong representation of customers** in the **20 to 40 age range**, making them the core audience.\n\n2. **Declining Representation in Older Demographics:**\n   - As we move into the **50+ age group**, the frequency of customers declines significantly.\n   - Customers in their **60s and 70s** still exist in the dataset but in **low numbers**, suggesting that the mall may attract fewer older customers.\n\n3. **Age Spread Across the Data:**\n   - The age distribution shows a **relatively even spread** within the **18 to 50 range**, with a **decrease** as we move towards older age groups.\n   - This indicates that the mall sees a **fairly balanced representation** across young to middle-aged individuals, with a slight decline in the older groups.\n\n### **Business Implications:**\n\n1. **Targeted Marketing and Promotions:**\n   - Given that the largest group of customers falls within the **20‚Äì40 age range**, marketing campaigns should focus on **young adults** and **young professionals**. \n   - Promotions related to **fashion, lifestyle products**, or **entertainment** (e.g., movie or concert discounts) could yield the best results.\n\n2. **Store Product Selection:**\n   - A customer base that is primarily **young to middle-aged** suggests that the mall should focus on **contemporary** and **trendy products** such as **technology**, **fashion**, and **entertainment**.\n   - It may also be beneficial for the mall to **curate its stores** around these preferences to meet the demands of the majority of its shoppers.\n\n3. **Loyalty Programs:**\n   - The mall could design **loyalty programs** aimed at **young professionals** or **students**. Exclusive benefits, like discounts or points for repeat purchases, can help build customer loyalty and encourage frequent visits.\n\n4. **Identifying Growth Areas:**\n   - While the mall has strong engagement from younger customers, **older customers** (50+) are underrepresented. This presents an opportunity to introduce targeted marketing strategies that cater to this age group, such as:\n     - **Health and wellness promotions**\n     - **Senior discounts**\n     - **Specialized product offerings** for those 50+\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe **age distribution** provides valuable insights into the mall's core customer base and helps refine strategies for **targeted marketing**, **product offerings**, and **customer engagement**. By focusing on **young adults** (20-40 years old), the mall can further optimize its marketing efforts and promotions. Additionally, by expanding efforts to attract **older customers**, the mall can diversify its audience and increase overall foot traffic.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Income Distribution","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.line(df['Income'].reset_index(),\n              x=\"Income\",\n              title=\"Income Distribution\")\nfig.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-24T02:22:30.018327Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-24T02:22:30.018548Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-24T02:22:31.618051Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-24T02:22:30.018531Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-24T02:22:31.617172Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#808080 solid; padding: 15px; background-color:##F0E68C ; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n\n## üìä Income Distribution: Insights & Business Implications\n\n### **Chart Overview:**\nThe following line plot provides a visual representation of the **income distribution** within the dataset. It shows the frequency of each income value across the customers, with the **x-axis** representing income values and the **y-axis** showing the corresponding count of customers.\n\n### **Key Insights:**\n1. **Income Variability:**\n   - The distribution of income is **widely spread**, with several income levels having varying counts of customers. \n   - There are **clusters of customers** with similar incomes around certain values (e.g., 54k, 78k), indicating that these income ranges are more common among mall visitors.\n\n2. **Higher Concentration of Income Ranges:**\n   - Some income ranges, such as **54k** and **78k**, have **higher frequencies**, suggesting that these income levels are the **most common** among customers.\n   - The **lower frequencies** at extreme values (both low and high incomes) suggest that the mall does not attract as many customers at these ends of the income spectrum.\n\n3. **Diverse Customer Base:**\n   - The dataset contains customers across a **wide range of income levels**, from lower-income customers to more affluent individuals, but with some concentration around middle-income levels.\n\n### **Business Implications:**\n\n1. **Targeted Marketing:**\n   - The mall can create **income-targeted marketing campaigns**. For example:\n     - Customers in **middle-income brackets** (e.g., 54k‚Äì78k) can be offered promotions for **affordable luxury goods** or **mid-range product offerings**.\n     - For customers with **lower incomes**, the mall could focus on **discounted products** and **budget-friendly promotions**.\n\n2. **Product Selection:**\n   - With a diverse customer base in terms of income, the mall should ensure that its product range caters to both **middle and lower-income customers**. \n   - Offering a **variety of price points**, such as **affordable fashion** for lower-income groups and **premium products** for higher-income individuals, would allow the mall to appeal to a broader audience.\n\n3. **Loyalty Programs:**\n   - Implementing **loyalty programs** based on income levels could be a successful strategy:\n     - **Discounts for frequent shoppers** in the middle-income range.\n     - **Exclusive rewards or access** to high-end products for more affluent customers.\n\n4. **Expanding Reach to High-Income Customers:**\n   - While the mall sees a significant amount of middle-income traffic, it may want to implement strategies to attract **higher-income individuals**.\n     - Targeting **luxury items**, offering **exclusive VIP experiences**, or hosting **special events** can appeal to this demographic.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe **income distribution** reveals key customer segments based on their financial capacity, helping the mall refine its **marketing strategies**, **product assortment**, and **loyalty programs**. By targeting both **middle-income** and **higher-income customers** with customized offers, the mall can **optimize sales** and **enhance customer satisfaction** across different income groups.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Distribution of Gender","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pie_fig = px.pie(df, names='Gender', title='Distribution of Gender')\npie_fig.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-24T02:22:31.618856Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-24T02:22:31.619073Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-24T02:22:31.681332Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-24T02:22:31.619056Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-24T02:22:31.680565Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#808080 solid; padding: 15px; background-color:##F0E68C ; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n\n## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Gender Distribution: Insights & Business Implications\n\n### **Chart Overview:**\nThe following **pie chart** illustrates the **gender distribution** of customers in the dataset.

The **spending score** ranges from **1 to 100** and reflects the customer‚Äôs spending behavior, with higher values indicating higher spending activity. The histogram includes a **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)** for a smoother view of the distribution, with **20 bins** to capture the frequency of scores.\n\n### **Key Insights:**\n1. **Moderate Spending Scores:**\n   - The distribution shows a **concentration** of customers with spending scores around **40-60**, indicating that a large portion of the customer base tends to have **moderate spending behavior**.\n   - Customers with a **high spending score** (closer to 100) are **relatively few** in comparison, which suggests that only a small percentage of customers are big spenders.\n\n2. **Spread Across the Range:**\n   - The **spread of spending scores** ranges from **very low (close to 1)** to **moderately high** (up to the 70s or 80s). This indicates that there are customers who spend **very little** and others who spend **significantly**, but the majority of customers fall into the middle range.\n\n3. **Outliers:**\n   - A few **outlier spending scores** on both ends (e.g., **scores as low as 1 and high as 100**) are visible, showing that there are some customers with extreme spending behaviors.\n\n### **Business Implications:**\n\n1. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:**\n   - For customers with **high spending scores**, the mall can create **premium offers** or **exclusive rewards**. For example:\n     - **Luxury products**, **VIP access**, or **personalized services** could appeal to high-spending customers.\n   - On the other hand, for customers with **moderate or low spending scores**, the mall could focus on **budget-friendly promotions**, **discount offers**, or **frequent shopper incentives** to encourage higher spending.\n\n2. **Customer Segmentation for Promotions:**\n   - The mall can segment customers into **high, medium, and low spending groups** based on their spending scores. This would enable more **personalized and effective promotions**:\n     - **High spenders**: Offer them **exclusive products** or **loyalty points** to retain their business.\n     - **Low spenders**: Provide them with **special discounts** or **encouragement to increase visits**.\n\n3. **Product Placement and Stock Management:**\n   - The mall can use this data to **optimize product placement**:\n     - For customers with **higher spending scores**, place **premium products** or **high-end brands** in easily accessible locations.\n     - For **low-spending customers**, products that are **affordable** and **value for money** should be more prominently displayed.\n\n4. **Personalized Shopping Experiences:**\n   - The mall can introduce **personalized shopping experiences** based on spending behavior:\n     - For customers with **low to moderate spending** scores, personalized **discounts** could be offered based on past purchases or frequency of visits.\n     - For **high-spending customers**, VIP programs or personalized **shopping assistants** could enhance their experience.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe **spending score distribution** helps the mall to identify distinct customer segments based on their spending behaviors. By leveraging this information, the mall can design **targeted marketing strategies**, create **customized promotions**, and **optimize product placement** to enhance the shopping experience for both low and high spenders.

Customer Demographics Overview\n\n- **Gender Distribution:**  \n  - Females make up **56%** of the customers, while males represent **44%**.  \n  - This slight female majority suggests tailoring some promotions and product lines to female shoppers could be beneficial.\n\n- **Age Distribution:**  \n  - Most customers fall within the **20‚Äì40 years** range.  \n  - Peaks were noticed around ages **32 and 35**, indicating a strong presence of young professionals and middle-aged adults.\n\n- **Annual Income (k$):**  \n  - Income levels vary widely, with a concentration between **$40k and $80k**.  \n  - This suggests the mall mainly attracts **middle-income individuals**.\n\n---\n\n### üí≥ 2. Spending Behavior\n\n- **Spending Score (1‚Äì100):**  \n  - The score is fairly evenly distributed, with slight clustering around **42, 55, and 73**, reflecting **diverse spending habits**.  \n  - Some customers spend heavily despite low income and vice versa, which highlights opportunities for targeted financial products or offers.\n\n---\n\n### üîç 3. Relationships & Comparisons\n\n- **Age vs. Spending Score:**  \n  - Young adults (18‚Äì35) display **higher variability in spending**.  \n  - A **negative trend** is visible with age ‚Äî older customers tend to spend less.\n\n- **Income vs. Spending Score:**  \n  - There is **no strong linear correlation** between income and spending.  \n  - Interestingly, both high and low spenders can exist across all income groups, supporting the use of clustering rather than rule-based segmentation.\n\n- **Gender vs. Spending Score:**  \n  - Females show a **slightly higher average spending score**, suggesting greater shopping engagement.\n\n- **Income Group vs. Spending Score:**  \n  - The spending distribution is **diverse across income groups**, reinforcing that **income alone isn't a good predictor** of customer value.\n\n---\n\n### üåê 4. Multivariate Insights\n\n- **Facet Grid Analysis:**  \n  - Younger females tend to score higher in spending, while older age groups show flatter distributions.  \n  - This can help in age-gender-specific **ad targeting and messaging**.\n\n- **Correlation Heatmap:**  \n  - Low correlation values confirm the **need for unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering)** to find hidden patterns.\n\n- **Parallel Coordinates Plot:**  \n  - Helps visualize how customer profiles shift across multiple variables, useful for **persona creation**.\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ Business Recommendations\n\n1. **Segmentation Needed:**  \n   Demographic variables alone do not fully explain customer behavior ‚Äî using clustering (e.g., K-Means) can reveal deeper insights.\n\n2. **Targeted Promotions:**  \n   - Young female customers with moderate income and high spending scores are prime candidates for personalized promotions.\n   - Low-income high spenders could be offered installment plans or loyalty rewards.\n\n3. **Product & Pricing Strategy:**  \n   Tailor offerings based on demographic patterns ‚Äî more luxury offerings for high-income low spenders, and trend-focused products for young high spenders.\n\n---\n\n### üìå Next Steps\n\n- Apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) for **customer segmentation**.\n- Create customer personas based on clusters to drive **targeted marketing**.\n- Use the insights to **optimize inventory, promotions, and store layouts**.\n\n---\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#

and understanding customer behavior through visual and statistical analysis, we moved to the **modeling stage**, focusing on **customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering**.\n\n---\n\n### üìå Objective\nTo group customers into distinct clusters based on their **annual income** and **spending score**, enabling more strategic decision-making for marketing and customer relationship management.\n\n---\n\n### ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Steps\n- Renamed columns for consistency and clarity.\n- Encoded categorical features using `LabelEncoder`.\n- Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler` to normalize data for better clustering performance.\n\n---\n\n### üîç K-Means Clustering\nWe applied the **K-Means clustering algorithm**, experimenting with a range of clusters from **k = 2 to k = 10**. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we evaluated each configuration using the **Silhouette Score**, which measures how well each data point fits into its assigned cluster.\n\n#### üìà Silhouette Scores per Cluster Count\n\n| Number of Clusters (k) | Silhouette Score |\n|------------------------|------------------|\n| 2                      | 0.293            |\n| 3                      | 0.384            |\n| 4                      | 0.405            |\n| 5                      | **0.444** ‚úÖ      |\n| 6                      | **0.452** ‚úÖ      |\n| 7                      | 0.439            |\n| 8                      | 0.429            |\n| 9                      | 0.414            |\n| 10                     | 0.377            |\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ Optimal Clusters: 5 or 6\nThe **highest silhouette score** was observed at **k = 6 (0.452)**, closely followed by **k = 5 (0.444)**. Both values indicate well-defined and meaningful clusters. Either option is suitable depending on the desired level of customer segmentation granularity.\n\n> ‚ÑπÔ∏è *Note: To avoid future warnings from scikit-learn, we used `n_init='auto'` in our `KMeans()` implementation.*\n\n---\n\n### üìä Outcome\nThe K-Means model successfully segmented the mall's customers into distinct groups based on their income and spending patterns. These insights can now be used for:\n- üéØ **Targeted marketing and promotions**\n- üõí **Personalized customer recommendations**\n- üí° **Strategic product placement**\n- üîÅ **Retention and loyalty program optimization**\n\n---\n","metadata":{}}]}
